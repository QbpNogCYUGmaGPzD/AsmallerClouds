Schematic/PCB files for an 8HP version of Clouds

This Eagle project uses the original mutable instruments design files. It simply repositions all components to fit in an 8HP module.
I did this layout as a side project because I love the clouds module and wanted more in my system without sacrificing other space! The only component change is the crystals to a smaller package, 3mm red/green LEDs and a different illuminated push button.
